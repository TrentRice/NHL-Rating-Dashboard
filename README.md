# Diving deep into NHL Analytics. A Visual Analysis of Player Performance

In modern hockey analysis, comparing players across different seasons, positions, and eras is a complex challenge. Is a 30-goal scorer from 2010 more valuable than a 25-goal scorer today? How do we measure the decline of a star player or the rise of a defensive specialist beyond simple points and plus-minus? The answers often lie hidden in deeper, more advanced metrics.

This forms the basis of why I decided to create the player analysis dashboard detailed in this article. I wanted to build a dynamic, interactive tool that empowers users to explore the careers of any NHL player from 2007-08 to 2024-25. By visualizing advanced statistics, this dashboard moves beyond the box score to reveal the underlying components of a player's performance.

This project set out to answer three key questions that users can explore for any player:

How has a player's overall value to their team, measured by Wins Above Replacement (WAR), trended throughout their career?
Which specific skillsâ€”like Finishing, Playmaking, or Defence have defined their peak years versus their later seasons?
How does one player's statistical profile in a given year compare to another's, providing a data-driven basis for evaluation?
By breaking down player performance into these granular components, we can gain a much deeper appreciation for their unique career arcs and true impact on the ice.
